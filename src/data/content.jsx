      <strong>Sindikat Sina Roza</strong> (The Blue Rose Syndicate) is Seattle’s only 
      dedicated Balkan brass band, blending complex rhythms, rich vocal harmonies, 
      and ornamented melodies in a (mostly) acoustic, high-energy format designed for 
      immersive, participatory performance. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Rooted in anti-fascist, anti-capitalist values, the band celebrates Romani liberation, folk heritage, and the evolving 
      Balkan tradition while rejecting commercial constraints. With unique 
      instrumentation and a commitment to radical inclusivity, the band creates 
      transformative experiences that unite audiences through dance, music, and 
      revolutionary joy.

  We are guided by values of community, creativity, and social justice, treating Balkan brass music as a living, evolving tradition. We balance cultural sensitivity with the freedom to innovate, prioritizing joy, collaboration, and inclusivity over perfection or profit. We’re inspired by a shared passion for making incredible music together in a supportive and fun environment. More than just a band, we see ourselves as a creative collective where music, art, and culture intersect to build something vibrant, meaningful, and deeply human.
  <br />
  <br />
  Our music evokes a vivid world of emotion and memory—joyous village dances, smoky taverns, Romani weddings, and sunlit courtyards. It blends nostalgia with mystery, celebration with struggle, and carries symbols of resilience. To us, the Balkans are a land of contrasts—where community and complexity meet, and where the bitter and the sweet, like the music itself, are always intertwined.
